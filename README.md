Hey!
=================
I created this website in February 2022 using HTML and CSS. I wanted to build this
site to combine my experiences and creativity in a way that my resume and LinkedIn don't. 

I only had minimal knowledge on hands-on web development prior to this personal website, as previous projects have been dependent on website building platforms like Wix.com. However, after months of self-learning and taking inspiration from different sources, I have put together my own remix of Resume and LinkedIn.
